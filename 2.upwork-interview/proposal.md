## Cover Letter

Dear ServiceNow Customer Outcomes Team,

I am the founder of **Forenly AI** and a process automation specialist with a deep focus on **Source-to-Pay (S2P) and Finance & Supply Chain (FSC) transformations**. I am particularly excited about this role given your emphasis on leveraging AI to drive customer outcomes—a core mission of my consultancy.

**Why I am the ideal candidate for this engagement:**

1. **S2P & FSC Process Expertise:**
I bring extensive experience in leading design workshops for **Source-to-Contract, P2P, and Record-to-Report (R2R)** workflows. My methodology aligns perfectly with ServiceNow’s **"Configuration vs. Customization"** philosophy, ensuring scalability and long-term value for global organizations.

2. **AI-Native Automation (The Future of S2P):**
Your requirement for "integrating AI into work processes" is exactly where I differentiate. I have recently architected and deployed autonomous S2P pipelines on GCP that utilize **Vertex AI (Gemini) and Document AI** to:
- Reduce **3-Way Match** manual review time from hours to minutes.
- Automate **Supplier Discovery & AI-based Qualification**.
- Implement intelligent fraud detection in Accounts Payable.
I can help ServiceNow customers not just implement a platform, but lead the way in **AI-driven procurement.**

3. **Bridging the ERP Gap:**
I understand the complexity of global environments. I have a solid track record of integrating specialized S2P layers with legacy systems like **SAP Ariba and Oracle**, ensuring ServiceNow remains the primary system of action for Customer Outcomes.

4. **Strategic Documentation & Agile Delivery:**
I am proficient in drafting functionality-focused **user stories** and acceptance criteria. I guide stakeholders from ambiguous business requirements to concrete **BPMN maps** and configuration workbooks.

**Quick Stats:**
- **Availability:** GMT+3 (2-hour overlap with CET / Full-time 40 hrs/week).
- **Recent Success:** Reduced a client's invoice processing friction by **90%** using AI-native OCR and validation logic.
- **ServiceNow Alignment:** Passionate about driving adoption through best-practice-based solutions.

I have a **working demo of an AI-powered S2P pipeline** on my GCP instance which I would be happy to walkthrough during our interview to demonstrate how we can accelerate ServiceNow customer outcomes.

Best regards,

**Bahadir Ciloglu**  
Founder & Sr. Consultant — Forenly AI
